# Account On It!

Being a property manager can be tough, especially when managing an apartment complex with plenty of nice people you want to keep happy,
and being a tenant on the hunt for a good place to rest your head that also won't break the bank can be even tougher. With these thoughts
in mind, I present to you, 'Account On It.' On one hand I'd love to provide property managers and landlords with the tools necessary
to keep their properties and residences running in tip-top shape. On the other, I want to provide tenants with an easy to use portal
to contact their landlord, keep track of rent, and foster a great landlord-tenant relationship. As a bonus, anyone looking for a new place
in a new city or for a place just down the freeway can find one here, a place with all-star reviews, reasonable rent, and a friendly community.

## Features So Far

-   Login
-   Listing Landlords' tenants & properties
-   Adding tenants and properties to a landlord's list
-   Tenants can view their property, landlord info, and their own info

## Coming Soon

-   Account Registration

## Features for the Future

-   Search Bar for tenants vs Search Bar for landlords
    -   Tenants can look up other properties as they approach the end of their lease as well as fellow tenants
    -   Landlords can look up their tenants, properties, and more.
-   Notify upcoming rent, upcoming leases ending
-   Property listings with reviews, rent estimates (can be exact prices too if preferred by property owner)

## About Laravel

Laravel is a web application framework with expressive, elegant syntax. We believe development must be an enjoyable and creative experience to be truly fulfilling. Laravel takes the pain out of development by easing common tasks used in many web projects, such as:

-   [Simple, fast routing engine](https://laravel.com/docs/routing).
-   [Powerful dependency injection container](https://laravel.com/docs/container).
-   Multiple back-ends for [session](https://laravel.com/docs/session) and [cache](https://laravel.com/docs/cache) storage.
-   Expressive, intuitive [database ORM](https://laravel.com/docs/eloquent).
-   Database agnostic [schema migrations](https://laravel.com/docs/migrations).
-   [Robust background job processing](https://laravel.com/docs/queues).
-   [Real-time event broadcasting](https://laravel.com/docs/broadcasting).

Laravel is accessible, powerful, and provides tools required for large, robust applications.
